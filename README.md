# Second-Class

# Class0002 - HTML

# House Keeping

- your server space is coming
- email me ever week by midnight Thursday evening with 2 questions and URLs to your projects
- this weekend http://yami-ichi.biz/nyc/ is a cool internet thing.

# Today's Schedule

- HTML Some things to consider:
  - structure of a page
- where do all the files go?
- HTML
	- document type
- CSS
- Document
	- what is the dom?
	- html describes the dom somewhat like a blueprint
	- the browser renders the dom: builds the structure of the house
	- the css styles the house: paint, furniture, interior design
	- finally, but not for today, javascript can re-model the home.
- width / height
- 0,0 (origin)
- x,y
- as an artist width is defined by size of window which i set by the viewer. this is REALLY different from print!!!!

# HTML
- HTML is pretty simple. I find it’s always better to keep your HTML to a minimum and put the heavy lifting in the CSS and Javascript. Today we’ll try and cover some basic tags and syntax.
- CSS is INCREDIBLY powerful! However, the most important thing is the syntax and being able to look up features of CSS because there is way too much to cover in class. We won't be looking at CSS today, but stay tuned!

- HTML - What is a tag?
- start tag
- attribute
	- name, value
- contents
- end tag
- head
	- including files
	- head HTML elements
	- title
	- script (not today)
	- link (not today)
	- meta
- body
	- html elements
	- basic text
		- p
		- h1/h2/h3
	- lists
		- ul, li
	- div
	- span
	- a
	- img
	- pre

- folder structures and relative paths

# Human Programming Exercise

Materials: 1 Pencil. 1 Piece of 11x17 White Paper

Write a set of instructions that anyone can follow to create a prescribed visual output.

Example: Sol Lewitt

Wall Drawing #797: The first drafter has a black marker and makes an irregular horizontal line near the top of the wall. Then the second drafter tries to copy it (without touching it) using a red marker. The third drafter does the same, using a yellow marker. The fourth drafter does the same using a blue marker. Then the second drafter followed by the third and fourth copies the last line drawn until the bottom of the wall is reached, 1995

# My Example

- pick up your pencil or a pen
- put the tip of the pencil(or pen) down near a corner about 1” from the corner
- start drawing a line until you’re half way to the other corner
- switch angles 45 degrees in any direction
- draw for 2 inches
- switch angles
- go to step 5 but repeat with half the distanced (repeat 3 times)

# Next Week!

Programming! Whaaaaat?! We’re going to learn about programming using two environments: processing, and javascript. JavaScript can be a bit confusing so we’ll start with universal basics in processing and then take that knowledge to the web! Also Processing is super super fun.
